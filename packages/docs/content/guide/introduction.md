# Introduction

The <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> library is an advanced tool designed for developers creating applications with Vue.js and Nuxt.js. The main features of this library are its support for accessibility and flexibility in styling. The library consists of two main types of components:

## Unstyled Components

These components are designed with accessibility in mind. This means they are constructed in a way that makes the application easy to use for people with various limitations, such as blind or visually impaired users, or those who have difficulty using a mouse. Features of these components include:

<ul>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Semantic HTML: </b> The components use semantic HTML5 elements, which improves their understandability for both users and assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</li>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">ARIA Support: </b>  The components are equipped with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes, which provide additional information about the user interface, aiding users who rely on assistive technologies.</li>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Keyboard Navigation: </b>  All components are optimized for keyboard navigation, which is crucial for users who cannot use pointing devices.</li>
</ul>

## Styled Components Using Tailwind CSS

These components not only support accessibility but also offer advanced styles using Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and aesthetic appearance. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for quick and flexible styling customization. Key features of these components include:

<ul>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Compatibility with Tailwind CSS: </b>All components are compatible with Tailwind CSS classes, allowing for easy and fast creation of custom styles without writing CSS from scratch.</li>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Reusability:  </b>  The components can be easily reused across different projects, speeding up application development and ensuring visual consistency.</li>
  <li><b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Responsiveness: </b> Thanks to Tailwind CSS, the components are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, which is crucial for today's web applications.</li>
</ul>
