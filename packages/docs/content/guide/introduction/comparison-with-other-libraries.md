# Comparison with other libraries

The <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> library stands out among other UI component libraries for Vue due to its unique combination of headless and pre-styled components, along with its strong focus on accessibility and customization. Here's a comparison highlighting these features:

## Comparison with Other Vue UI Component Libraries:

### Vuetify:

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Vuetify: </b>A comprehensive material design component library for Vue.js that comes with a wide range of pre-styled components adhering to the Material Design guidelines.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b>: Unlike Vuetify, which follows a specific design language (Material Design), <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> offers both headless components and components styled with Tailwind CSS. This allows for greater flexibility in design and customization to fit various project styles, beyond the Material Design aesthetic.

### Element UI:

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Element UI:</b> Known for its extensive set of ready-made, styled components designed for desktop applications.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b>: While Element UI provides pre-styled components, <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> not only provides styled components but also headless components that prioritize accessibility. This dual approach allows developers to either use the pre-styled components for quick development or customize the headless components to create a unique design language tailored to their needs.

### Buefy:

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b>: While Quasar excels in providing a broad framework for various types of applications, <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> focuses specifically on accessibility and flexible styling.
