# Why Pea ?

The name <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">PEA</b> (pea) can be exceptionally fitting and symbolic for this library because a pea pod consists of many small elements enclosed in one shell. This perfectly reflects the structure and philosophy of the PEA-Vue.js library. Here's how we can expand on this:

## Multiplicity of Elements

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Small but important components.</b> Just like peas in a pod, PEA-Vue.js components are small, independent units that may be simple on their own, but together they create something larger and more valuable. Each component can be used individually, but their full potential is realized when used together.

## Cohesion within One Shell

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Integrated application. </b> Just as peas are enclosed in one shell, PEA-Vue.js components are designed to work together within a single application. This means that despite their independence, they are designed to work in harmony, creating a cohesive and well-functioning whole.

## Ease of Management

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Flexibility in use. </b> Peas in a pod can be easily taken out and used in various contexts. Similarly, PEA-Vue.js components are flexible and can be customized to meet different project needs, allowing for reuse and application scalability.

## Symbol of Cooperation

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Harmony and integration. </b> Peas in a pod coexist in harmony, symbolizing that PEA-Vue.js components are designed to work together. Their integration ensures smooth operation of the application, which is crucial for end users.

## Accessibility and Usability

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Ease of access. </b> The pea is a symbol of something small and accessible. Similarly, PEA-Vue.js is designed to be easy to use and accessible to developers of various skill levels, while also ensuring accessibility for end users.

### Summary

The name <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">PEA</b> (pea) is an apt and symbolic choice for the PEA-Vue.js library because it perfectly reflects its structure, philosophy, and main features. Just like peas in a pod, PEA-Vue.js components are small but significant elements that together form an integrated and cohesive application. This symbolism highlights modularity, cohesion, ease of management, and accessibility, which are key advantages of this library.
