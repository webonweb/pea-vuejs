# Two modules one library

The <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> library offers two main ways to use its components, catering to different developer needs: through unstyled (headless) components and ready-made, styled components using Tailwind CSS. Hereâ€™s how these options can be utilized:

## Unstyled Components (Headless Components):

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Styling flexibility:</b> Headless components are provided without built-in styles, giving you complete control over their appearance. You can apply any styling method, such as CSS, SCSS, LESS, or other CSS frameworks, to customize the look of the components to suit your project's needs.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Integration with existing styles:</b> Because the components have no predefined styles, they can easily be integrated with existing styles and themes in your application, maintaining visual consistency.<br/><br/>
Accessibility support: Despite lacking styles, headless components are designed with accessibility in mind, including semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, making it easier to create accessible applications.

## Ready-Made, Styled Components with Tailwind CSS:

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Quick implementation:</b> These components are pre-styled using Tailwind CSS, allowing for quick deployment and saving time during application development.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Visual consistency:</b> With Tailwind CSS, the components have a modern and aesthetic appearance, ensuring visual consistency throughout the application.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Easy customization:</b> Tailwind CSS enables easy overriding of default colors and other style aspects. You can customize colors, spacing, typography, and other elements through Tailwind configuration to match your branding requirements and project specifics.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Responsiveness:</b> Styled components with Tailwind CSS are responsive, meaning they will look good on various devices and screen sizes.

## Summary

The <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> library provides developers with the flexibility to choose their preferred styling approach, adapting to different needs and preferences. You can choose between:

<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Unstyled components (headless):</b> Ideal if you need complete control over styling and want to apply your own custom styles.<br/><br/>
<b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Ready-made, styled components with Tailwind CSS:</b> Perfect for quickly implementing aesthetic components while still having the ability to easily customize colors and other styles.
<br/><br/>
With these two options, <b class="text-[#d5e47c]">Pea VueJs</b> offers versatility and flexibility, allowing you to create both unique, custom user interfaces and quickly deploy visually consistent applications.
